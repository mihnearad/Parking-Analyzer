# Parking-Analyzer

Welcome to the Parking-Analyzer project! This tool emerged from a blend of my interests in Python and PostgreSQL. If you've ever lived in a crowded area, you know parking can be a bit of a puzzle. With this tool, I aimed to demystify that puzzle a bit.

## Overview

Parking-Analyzer isn't just about marking spots as occupied or vacant. It tracks the orientation of parked cars. A seemingly minor detail, but in tight parking spots, it matters whether a car has pulled in nose-first or backed in.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: The main powerhouse behind this project.
- **PostgreSQL**: Used for robust data storage and retrieval.
  
## Key Takeaways

- **Python**: Enhanced my hands-on experience, particularly with GUIs and database integration.
- **PostgreSQL**: Delved deeper into SQL queries and database management.
- **Practical Utility**: Addressed a real-world problem with a tech solution.

## Going Forward

There's potential for this tool. Future iterations might include camera integration for automatic parking status detection or even real-time notifications. Always room to innovate! At the moment, the input is done by using a CCTV camera mounted on the building. 

## Wrap Up

Navigating through this project has been both challenging and enlightening. It's a functional tool that also allowed me to expand my technical knowledge. If parking's an issue where you are, or if you're just curious about the code, feel free to explore. Feedback is always appreciated!
